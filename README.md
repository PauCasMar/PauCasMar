Hi there! 👋 I'm Paula
I'm a Software Development student, excited to keep learning and growing in the amazing world of tech. 🚀

I recently completed my internship at Accenture, where I had the chance to take my first steps in a professional environment and learn from some incredible people. During that time, I strengthened my skills in Java and Python, and got a real taste of teamwork, problem-solving, and building meaningful solutions. 💡

Here you'll find some of my projects, ideas, experiments, and everything in between — it's all part of the journey. I'm constantly learning, and every line of code is a step forward. 🧠✨

🔧 Technologies I've worked with:
- Java ☕
- Python 🐍
- Git & GitHub 🗂️
- And a whole lot of curiosity...

 ✨ What makes me glow (interests)

🎾 Playing paddle in amateur city championships.
🏄🏻‍♀️ Surfing like a clumsy duck
💪🏻 Gym and kinda crossfit , as far as my knees let me

📌 What's next:
My goal is to keep exploring new technologies, contribute to real-world projects, and grow into a developer who makes an impact. I love challenges, clean code, and learning something new every day.
